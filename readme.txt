The Simple NASDAQ Index is a simple index of companies based on the volume of the equity being traded, the change in target price, and the expected returns of a NASDAQ listed equity.

Pros:
- Runs with no bugs
- Gives another perspective for looking at stocks

Cons:
- Data must be manually mined and massaged on a daily basis (downloads from eoddata.com and going through the Reuter's Research Roundup online)
- Only includes data from NASDAQ listed equities. 

Lessons Learned:
- Need practicing webscraping websites and/or finding data online
- Need to practice pandas practice
